# Npp-Highlighter Plugin (Notepad++)

Npp-Highlighter allows you to highlight the changed part and double click selected text in Notepad++.

Many thanks to Sieukrem, this plugin is based on his plugin - jN, from here
[https://github.com/sieukrem/jn-npp-plugin](https://github.com/sieukrem/jn-npp-plugin)

Highlighter disabled the javascript functions from jN, only use the bar to display the changed and highlighted results.
